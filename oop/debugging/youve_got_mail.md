We can see from the error message that the method `'860 Blackbird Ln'` does not exist in the `PostalService` class. Upon inspection, it seems that the `Object#send` method is actually in action on line 91, which invokes its first argument, that being `'860 Blackbird Ln'`, which does not exist. When investigating why the programmer may have tried to use this, a `send` instance method is found in the `Mailing` module that seems to fit the intended approach.

In order for this method to be accessible by the `PostalService` class, it has to be included as a mixin. It's also a good idea to rename this method to something a bit more descriptive, so to not override the method if needed to be used in the future.

```ruby
module Mailing
  # omitted for brevity

  def send_mail(destination, mail)
    "Sending #{mail} from #{name} to: #{destination}"
  end
end

class PostalService < CommunicationsProvider
  include Mailing

  # omitted for brevity
end
```
