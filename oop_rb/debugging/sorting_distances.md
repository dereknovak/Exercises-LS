When calling the `sort` method on an object, the spaceship operator `<=>` is used to sort the elements within the object. Because this operator, which is actually a method, is not defined in the `Length` class, the `ArgumentError` exception is thrown. To fix this, we simply need to define the `<=>` within the class, using the same format as `==` and `<`, but with `<=>` instead.

While not required to produce a working solution, a good way to refactor the code would be to remove all of the comparison methods and instead include the `Comparable` module as a mixin. Because each of the comparison methods within `Comparable` use the spaceship operator, simply defining it within `Length` will allow each of the included comparison methods to function properly.

```ruby
class Length
  include Comparable

  # Omitted for brevity

  def <=>(other)
    case unit
    when :km  then value <=> other.as_kilometers.value
    when :mi  then value <=> other.as_miles.value
    when :nmi then value <=> other.as_nautical_miles.value
    end
  end

  # Ommited for brevity
end
```
