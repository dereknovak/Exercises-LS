```ruby
class Flight
  attr_accessor :database_handle

  def initialize(flight_number)
    @database_handle = Database.init
    @flight_number = flight_number
  end
end
```

With both a getter and setter method being implemented for `:database_handle`, the entire codebase will have access to the data stored within its instance variable, which may not be the intent. To prevent this, the entirety of line 2 should be removed. If access is required, it would be wise to include `attr_reader` with this method with some access control. This would allow `@database_handle` to still be used within the class, but would prevent the exterior codebase from using the data.
