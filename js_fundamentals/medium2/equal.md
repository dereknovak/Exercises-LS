```js
const person = { name: 'Victor' };
const otherPerson = { name: 'Victor' };

console.log(person === otherPerson);
```

Although both variables reference objects with a similar property values, the objects are at completely different parts of memory. When used with objects, the `===` operator checks whether the objects referenced are at the same location in memeory, therefore it makes sense that this would log `false`.

To fix this code, you can create a copy of the reference to the original object and assign that copy to `otherPerson`.

```js
const person = { name: 'Victor' };
const otherPerson = person;

console.log(person === otherPerson);  // true
```
