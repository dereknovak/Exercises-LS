```js
const myObject = {
  a: 'name',
  'b': 'test',
  123: 'c',
  1: 'd',
};

myObject[1];
myObject[a];
myObject.a;
```

The bug in this code exists on line 9, where global variable `a` is attempted to be passed as an argument to the `[]` operator. Because `a` was never declared within the program, JavaScript cannot find its reference and therefore will throw a `ReferenceError` exception.

The intent here was most likely to find the value for property `'a'` within `myObject`. With this kind of notation, the property key should be represented as a string. The correct syntax would be `myObject['a']`.
