# Code Snippet 1

```js
var counter = 5;
var rate = 3;
console.log('The total value is ' + String(counter * rate));

function counter(count) {
  // ...
}
```
This will log `The total value is 15` as `counter` is reassigned to `5` after hoisting occurs.

# Code Snippet 2

```js
function counter(count) {
  // ...
}

console.log('The total value is ' + String(counter * rate));

var counter = 5;
var rate = 3;

```
This will log `The total value is NaN` as `counter` is a function and cannot be multiplied by a number, so the return is `NaN`.

# Code Snippet 3

```js
var counter = 5;
var rate = 3;

function counter(count) {
  // ...
}

console.log('The total value is ' + String(counter * rate));
```
This will log `The total value is 15` as the function `counter` is hoisted to the top. `counter` is then reassigned to `5` after hoisting.

# Code Snippet 4

```js
let counter = 5;
let rate = 3;

function counter(count) {
  // ...
}

console.log('The total value is ' + String(counter * rate));
```
This will throw an error, as `counter` has already by declared by the function during hoisting, and `let` will not ignore the duplication like `var` will.
