```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log(i);
  } else {
    i += 1;
  }
}
```

This code will place the program in an infinite loop due to the lack of incremenation while within the `if` branch of the statement. Once the condition is met (which immediately occurs on its first pass with `0`), the value will be logged, but not incremented. Therefore, the conditional expressions will indefinitely evaluate to `true`. This can be fixed by removing the `else` branch and simply increment each iteration of the loop.

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  
  i += 1;
}
```
