```Ruby
def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

puts meal
```
The code will output `Breakfast`.

On line 7, the defined method `meal` is invoked. Within the method, the string object `'Breakfast'` is immediately explicitly returned, via the `return` keyword, which terminates the method. This gets passed as an argument to the `puts` method invocation, which outputs it to the console.

It's important to note that the expression `puts 'Dinner'` on line 4 does not execute because of the explicit `return` on line 2, preventing `Dinner` from being output.
