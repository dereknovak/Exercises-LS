```Ruby
def tricky_number
  if true
    number = 1
  else
    2
  end
end

puts tricky_number
```
The code will output `1`.

On line 9, the defined method `tricky_number` is invoked. Within the method, an `if` statement is employed which checks whether `true` is a truthy value. Because `true` evalutes as true, the `if` branch is executed, which simply includes a variable assignment. Because variable assignment returns the value in which the variable was assigned, `1` is returned from the method and output by invocation of the `puts` method on line 9.

It's important to note that the assignment itself on line 3 is useless, as the method local variable `number` is never used outside of its assignment. Instead, a cleaner way to write the code would be to just have the integer `1`.
