```Ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
    if sheep >= 2
      return
    end
  end
end

p count_sheep
```
The code will output `0`, `1`, `2`, and `nil`, in sequence and on separate lines.

On line 10, the defined method `count_sheep` is invoked. Within the method, the `times` method is called on the integer `5` and gets passed a `do...end` block as an argument. The `times` method will iterate the block `5` times, with each iteration number, starting at iteration `0`, binding to the block's parameter `sheep`. Upon each iteration of the block, block local variable `sheep` is first output by invocation of the `puts` method. Then an `if` condition is employed, checking whether `sheep` is greater than or equal to `2`. After 3 iterations of the block, `sheep` will reference the integer `2`, meeting the condition and execute the explicit `return` keyword.

Because there are no arguments passed to `return`, the method will terminate and return `nil`. `nil` is then output by invocation of the `p` method on line 10. This early method termination is also the reason why the last 2 iterations of the block are not executed.
