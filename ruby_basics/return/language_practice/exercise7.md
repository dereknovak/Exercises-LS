```Ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
end

puts count_sheep
```
The code will output the integers `0` through `5`, inclusively, in sequence and on separate lines.

On line 7, the defined method `count_sheep` is invoked. Within the method, the `times` method is called on the integer `5` and gets passed a `do...end` block as an argument. The `times` method will iterate the block `5` times, with each iteration number, starting at iteration `0`, binding to the the block parameter `sheep`. Upon each iteration of the block, block local variable `sheep` gets passed as an argument to the `puts` method invocation, which outputs its value to the console. Because `sheep` references each iteration number and the block iterates `5` times, the integers `0` through `4` are output.

After block execution, `times` will return its caller, which in this case is `5`. Because this is the last line of the method, `5` will be returned from the method and output by invocation of the `puts` method on line 7.
