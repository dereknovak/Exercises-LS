```Ruby
process_the_loop = [true, false].sample

if process_the_loop
  loop do
    puts "The loop was processed."
    break
  end
else
  puts "The loop wasn't processed!"
end
```
On line 1, the `sample` method is called on an array object with the value `[true, false]`, which randomly selects one of its elements and assigns it to the initialized local variable `process_the_loop`.

From lines 3-10, an `if` statement is employed that checks whether `process_the_loop` references a truthy value. If evaluated as true (`true`), the `loop` method is invoked and is passed a `do...end` block as an argument. Within the block, the `puts` method is invoked and outputs `The loop was processed.`, immediately terminating the loop after 1 iteration using the `break` command. If evaluated as false (`false`), the `puts` method is simply invoked and outputs `The loop wasn't processed!`.

Each run of this code will output a random result, whether `process_the_loop` gets assigned `true` or `false`.
