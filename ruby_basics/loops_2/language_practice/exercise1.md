```Ruby
count = 1

loop do
  if count.even?
    puts "#{count} is even!"
  else
    puts "#{count} is odd!"  
  end

  break if count == 5
  count += 1
end
```
On line 1, local variable `count` is initialized and references an integer object with the value `1`. On line 3, the `loop` method is invoked and is passed a `do...end` block as an argument. Upon each iteration of the block, three actions occurs:

1. An `if` statement is employed that checks whether `count` is even or odd. If even, it will output a result such as `1 is even!`, using string interpolation to interpolate `count` into `"#{count} is even!"`. If odd, the same action occurs, except with the string `"#{count} is odd!"`.
2. A `break` command is employed that checks whether `count` is equal to `5`.
3. `count` is incremented by 1

After 5 iterations of the loop, `count` will have incremented to `5`, terminating the loop. In summary, the code will output `1 is odd!` or `2 is even!` up to `5`, inclusively, on separate lines.
