```Ruby a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b = 'yzzyX'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```
The code will output `Xyzzy`.

On line 1, local variable `a` is initialized and references a string object with the value `"Xyzzy"`. On line 7, `a` is passed as an argument to the defined `my_value` method invocation, binding its value to the method's parameter `b`. Within the method, method local variable `b` is reassigned to the string object `'yzzyX'`. Because of this reassignment, which creates a new string object, the alias relationship between `a` and `b` is broken; therefore, the original assignment of `a` to `"Xyzzy"` remains.
