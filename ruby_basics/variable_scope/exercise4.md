```Ruby a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b[2] = '-'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```
The code will output `Xy-zy`.

On line 1, local variable `a` is initialized and references a string object with the value `'Xyzzy'`. On line 7, `a` is passed as an argument to the `my_value` method invocation, binding its value to the method's parameter `b`. Within the method, the second index value of method local variable `b`, represented by `b[2]`, is reassigned to the string object `'-'` using the destructive `[]=` method, which mutates the assigned object to `'Xy-zy'`. Because `a` and `b` reference the same object, when `a` is passed as an argument to the `puts` method invocation, the mutated object is output.
