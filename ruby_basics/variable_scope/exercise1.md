```Ruby a = 7

def my_value(b)
  b += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```
The code will output `7`.

On line 1, local variable `a` is initialized and references an integer object with the value `7`. On line 7, `a` is passed as an argument to the defined `my_value` method invocation, binding its value to the method's parameter `b`. Within the method, method local variable `b` is reassigned to the sum of its value and 10, which returns `17`. Because of the reassignment, the alias relationship between `a` and `b` is broken, and therefore the value referenced by `a` will remain as `7`. This is why, when passed as an argument to the `puts` method invocation on line 8, the integer `7` is output rather than `17`.
