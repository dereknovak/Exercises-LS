What will the following code print, and why?
```Ruby
a = 7

def my_value(b)
  a = b
end

my_value(a + 5)
puts a
```
The code will output `7`.

On line 1, local variable `a` is initialized and references an integer object with the value `7`. On line 7, the sum of the value of `a` and `5` is passed as an argument to the defined `my_value` method, binding `12` to the method's parameter `b`. Within the method, method local variable `a` is initialized and references the same value as method local variable `b`. This, however, has no influence on `a` from outside the method's scope, as the `a` from within the method is completely separate than the `a` from outside of it.

This example demonstrates how Ruby approaches **variable scope** in regards to methods. A method has its own, self-contained scope, therefore it cannot access local variables initialized outside of its scope, nor the other way around.
