```Ruby
boolean = [true, false].sample

puts (boolean ? "I'm true!" : "I'm false!")
```
On line 1, the `sample` method is called on an array object containing the elements `[true, false]`, which randomly returns one of its elements and assign it to the initialized local variable `boolean`. On line 3, a ternary operator is employed as an argument to the `puts` method, which checks whether `boolean` references a truthy value. If evaluated as true (`true`), `I'm true!` will output; otherwise (`false`), `I'm false!'` will output.

Because `sample` returns a random element, each run of the code will have a random result.
