```Ruby
def print_me
  "I'm printing the return value!"
end

puts print_me
```
On line 5, the defined `print_me` method is invoked, which simply returns the string object `"I'm printing the return value!"`. This value is passed as an argument to the `puts` method invocation, which outputs it, without quotation marks, to the console.
