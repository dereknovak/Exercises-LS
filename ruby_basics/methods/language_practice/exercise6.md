```Ruby
def time_of_day(boolean)
  if boolean
    puts "It's daytime!"
  else
    puts "It's nighttime!"
  end
end

daylight = [true, false].sample
time_of_day(daylight)
```
On line 9, the `sample` method is called on the array object `[true, false]`, which randomly returns either boolean element, and assigns it to the initialized local variable `daylight`. On line 10, the defined method `time_of_day` is initialized and gets passed `daylight` as an argument, binding its value to the method's parameter `boolean`. Within the method, an `if` statement is employed, which checks if method local variable `boolean` references a truthy value. If evaluated as true (`true`), `It's daytime!` will output by invocation of the `puts` method; otherwise (`false`), `It's nighttime!` will output.

Because the assigned value of `daylight` on line 9 is random, each run of the program will output a random result.
