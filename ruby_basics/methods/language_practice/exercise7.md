In the original example, defined method `dog` gets passed the argument `'Spot'`, although there are no defined parameters within the method definition for it to bind to. Method local variable `name` is also employed on line 2, which has yet to be initialized. The cleanest method to revise this error would be to add the method parameter `name` to its definition, such as in the example below:
```Ruby
def dog(name)
  return name
end
```
The reverse problem occurs with the defined method `cat`, which establishes a method parameter, but no arguments are passed into the method on line 10. Instead, the string object `'Ginger'` should get passed as an argument to `cat` on line 10, such as in the example below:
```Ruby
puts "The cat's name is #{cat('Ginger')}."
```
This will allow the code to run error-free, outputting `The dog's name is Spot` and `The cat's name is Ginger` on separate lines.
